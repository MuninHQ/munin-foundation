## 2026-08-17 — Control Room architecture initiated

### Decision

Adopt a persistent Control Room operating model so Munin execution does not depend on reopening and reconstructing individual chats.

### Changes

- Defined repo-backed durable operational state.
- Defined `BUILD`, `CONT`, `SITREP`, and `NEXT` command semantics.
- Defined the autonomous engineering loop: `PLAN → BUILD → TEST → VERIFY → FIX`.
- Defined criteria for real human blockers versus recoverable execution issues.
- Created canonical current-state and backlog documents.
- Established a provider-agnostic executor model covering ChatGPT, Codex, Claude, local models, and future providers.

### Next

Create the accepted decision record, align portfolio ownership language, and implement the executor handoff/state hydration contracts.
